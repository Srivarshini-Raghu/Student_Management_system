# Student Management system

The student management system is designed to make management of the records and marks of the students. It provides the teacher with the facility to sign up, log in, and manage students. The teachers update the marks of the students regarding different subjects. The students can sign up, log in, and view their marks. SQLite is the database used for storing teachers' and students' information.

Teachers are the primary users of this system. Moreover, teachers can sign up for themselves with a unique username and password and can log in to the system using that username and password. When they do so, they will be taken to the teacher dashboard, from where they can manage all student information. It displays the total number of registered students along with a list of all of them. The detailed list of each student-which includes their username and marks obtained in different subjects-can be viewed by the teachers.

This system allows the teachers to update the student's marks. Teachers can click on the name or ID of any student; that will lead them to the mark editing page of that particular student. On the mark editing page, teachers will be able to provide the marks for different subjects. Once updated, the record gets saved to the database for accurate maintenance of the records.

Alongside this, the login feature is also provided for students. They have their usernames and passwords by which they create an account for themselves. After the registration process, they will be logged in to their particular dashboard pages. Now, for each and every student, there will be a personal Student's Dashboard. Within it, the information about the username of the student and the marks scored by him/her in different subjects will be provided. Hence, as a result, students can easily track their performances and changes in them over time.

In short, the student management system simplifies the task of handling student records and marks. The proposed system will contribute to the learning curve by using web technologies and friendly-user interfaces, helping to keep educational procedures more organized and productive.
