# Student Management system
The online student management system is designed to facilitate the management of student records and marks. It allows teachers to register, log in, and manage student data. Teachers can update the marks of students for different subjects. Students can also register, log in, and view their marks. The system uses SQLite as the database for storing teacher and student information.

Teachers are the primary users of the system. They can register by providing a unique username and password. Once registered, they can log in to access the teacher dashboard. The teacher dashboard serves as a centralized hub for managing student data. It displays the total number of registered students and provides a list of all students. Teachers can view the details of each student, including their username and marks obtained in different subjects.

The system allows teachers to update student marks. By clicking on a student's name or ID, teachers can access the mark editing page for that particular student. In the mark editing page, teachers can enter the marks for different subjects. The updated marks are then saved in the database, ensuring accurate record-keeping.

Students, on the other hand, have their own login functionality. They can register for an account by providing a unique username and password. Once registered, they can log in to access their individual dashboard. The student dashboard provides a personalized view for each student. It displays their username and the marks they have obtained in different subjects. Students can easily check their performance and track their progress over time.

Overall, the online student management system simplifies the process of managing student records and marks. By leveraging web technologies and user-friendly interfaces, the system aims to enhance the educational experience and contribute to a more organized and effective learning environment.
